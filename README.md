# File2Android

 File2Android is a Java program to easily send files to your Android device from your computer. It works on MacOS, Windows, Linux or any environment that supports Java.

 You probably experienced how big of a pain transfering a file to your Android device is. Using a cable sucks, and online file transfer mediums such as Gmail have file size limits and block some file extensions suspecting malware. There are many third party softwares and apps but most have them are frustating to use if not a scam. I created File2Android to make transfering any kind of file(s) of any sizes extremely easy.


 ## Installation
 
Download the File2Android.jar. You can run it by double clicking or running this command in terminal
```
java -jar File2Android.jar
```
Java Runtime Enviroment must be installed on your system to run File2Android or any Java program. You can easily install it from here

File2Android uses FTP protocol to transfer files to Android. You need to create a FTP server on your Android phone, which is very easy with this free app I found https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.medhaapps.wififtpserver

After opening the app click START and the server is ready. Now open File2Android and set the FTP Server URL to be the same with Android. Note that the computer and the Android device must be on the same network.
